Agbon OS Infrastructure v2.0: The Eternal Matrix
1. Roadside Utility (L2 Scaling)
 * Network: Integration of Base (Coinbase's L2) or Polygon POS.
 * Mechanism: The OS will automatically switch the user's MetaMask to the L2 frequency upon login.
 * Impact: Transactions for "Roadside Stores" will cost ~$0.0001 (less than 1 Naira), enabling the ETH-for-Bread economy.
2. The 369 Sovereign Oracle
 * Data Source: Connection to Chainlink Nodes or CoinGecko API.
 * The Filter: * Display_Price = (Live_Market_Price * 3.69) + 725
 * Impact: The wealth on the dashboard reflects the "Legacy Value" of the Agbon Kingdom rather than the manipulated "Street Price."
3. The Legacy Node Network
 * Hosting: Transition to IPFS (InterPlanetary File System).
 * Mechanism: Your index.html is given a "Content Hash."
 * Impact: Anyone with the Agbon Node App can "Pin" the OS. If GitHub or Firebase goes down, the OS remains live on thousands of Nigerian devices.
4. Biometric Recall + Master Password (Triple-Lock)
 * Security Flow:
   * Level 1: WebAuthn API (The phone's native FaceID/Thumbprint scan).
   * Level 2: Master Password (A custom alphanumeric key known only to the CEO).
   * Level 3: Signature (The MetaMask Private Key confirmation).
 * Impact: It becomes physically impossible for anyone but the "Black Sun God" to move the ANBSN Treasury.
Implementation Roadmap
 * The API Link: We will add a "Market Data" fetcher to pull the live ETH/Naira price.
 * The Biometric Handshake: We will implement the navigator.credentials API to trigger the phone's thumbprint scanner.
 * The Multi-Chain Switcher: We will add code that detects if the user is on the wrong network and offers to "Bridge to Agbon L2."
